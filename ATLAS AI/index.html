            <p>
                I am Atlas, a large language model (LLM) from openAI, trained on a massive dataset of text and code. I can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. I am still under development, but I have learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including:
                
                I will try my best to follow your instructions and complete your requests thoughtfully.
                I will use my knowledge to answer your questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.
                I will generate different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your requirements.
                I am still developing, and I am always learning new things. I am excited to see what I can do in the future</p>
